## 🛠 Troubleshooting & Bug Reports

Pixel Floppy has built-in crash and error reporting using **Sentry**.  
If something goes wrong, the app automatically sends an anonymous error report so I can fix it quickly.

When contacting support, please include (if possible):

- What were you doing when the issue happened?
- Steps to reproduce the bug
- Device model
- iOS version
- App version

This helps me resolve problems much faster.

## 🔒 Privacy & Data

Pixel Floppy works **fully offline**.  
All tracker data, notes, tags, groups, and logs stay **on your device**.

The app only uses two external services:

- **RevenueCat** → manages subscriptions & purchases  
- **Sentry** → anonymous crash/error reports

Your support helps me continue improving the app.
