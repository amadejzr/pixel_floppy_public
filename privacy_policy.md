# Privacy Policy  
**Last Updated: 27 November 2025**

This Privacy Policy explains how **Pixel Floppy** (“the App”) handles user data.  
The App is developed and maintained by **Amadej Jerlah s.p.**, based in Slovenia.

Your privacy is important. The App is designed to operate **offline-first**, and it does **not collect, store, or share any personal information**.

---

## 1. Data We Collect

### 1.1 Local Data (Stored on Your Device Only)
All user-created content—including trackers, tags, logs, notes, preferences, and statistics—is stored **locally** on your device using an offline database (Drift).

- No data is sent to external servers  
- We cannot access your data  
- We do not store backups  
- You fully control your data  

### 1.2 Crash & Diagnostic Data (Firebase Crashlytics)
To improve stability, the App uses **Firebase Crashlytics** to capture **anonymous** crash and error diagnostics.

Crashlytics may collect:
- crash logs  
- non-personal error diagnostics  
- device model  
- OS version  
- app version  
- minimal technical metadata required for debugging  

This data:
- does **not** contain personal information  
- is **not linked** to your identity  
- is used only for fixing bugs and improving performance  

Crash reporting is **disabled by default**.  
You can choose to enable anonymous crash reporting in:

**Settings → Privacy → Crash Reporting**

Only after enabling it will the App send crash logs to Firebase Crashlytics.

---

## 2. No Personal Information Collected
The App does **not** collect or process:

- name  
- email address  
- phone number  
- contacts  
- location  
- account information  
- identifiers  
- usage analytics tied to identity  
- sensitive information  

The App does not track, profile, or identify you.

---

## 3. Subscriptions and Payments

Pixel Floppy uses **RevenueCat** to manage subscription validation.  
RevenueCat receives only anonymous purchase receipts.  
No personal information is collected.

All purchases and payments are handled through:
- Apple App Store  
- Google Play Store  

We do not store or access:
- payment information  
- Apple/Google account details  
- personal identifiers  

We only receive a **non-identifiable subscription status** (active or inactive) that unlocks premium features within the App.

Refund requests must be submitted through:
- iOS: Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions → Report a Problem  
- Android: Google Play → Profile → Payments & Subscriptions  

---

## 4. Data Deletion

You can delete all App data at any time via:

**Settings → Data & Privacy → Clear All Data**

This permanently removes all local data stored on your device.  
Deleting the App also removes remaining stored data.

### Firebase Crashlytics (Crash Reporting)
